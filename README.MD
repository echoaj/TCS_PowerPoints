# TCS PowerPoints

A repo containing PowerPoints, quizzes, handouts, and other resources that I have created and gathered over 4 years of being a code coach.

## PowerPoints
A folder containing all of the PowerPoints that I have created during my time as a code coach.  About half of the PowerPoints are about DataStructures and Algorithms such as **linked lists**, **binary search trees**, and **recursion**.  The rest are about other topics in computer science like **protocols**, **web programming**, **machine learning**, and more.

These PowerPoints are super useful especially the recursion one since that's typically a hard topic to teach and visualize.  Other PowerPoints are still useful but may be hard to read since I like putting a lot of imagery in them and talk about the slides rather than having detailed written explains on the slides themselves.

## Handouts
In this folder, you will find handouts, reference data, project ideas, and visuals that introduce students to certain topics such as graph theory.  When I introduce students to lists, I will give them the **List Cheat Sheet** and do the **List Fun** excerises.

## Quizzes
Sometimes after I teach a topic to a student and make a project with that topic, I will give them a quiz to test their knowledge.  I like quizzes here and there because it gets the student thinking and helps me understand their skill level.
In addition, it's also a nice way to keep them busy if you have another student to teach.

## Scratch
When I was first hired at TCS, I made written tutorials in scratch so I could look at my notes while teaching the student.  I found these very helpful.  Feel free to reuse them!

## Random
Random documents I've collected over the years.
